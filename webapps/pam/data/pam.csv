Flemish Region (authority : VREG) :
Green certificates and CGP certificates are separate instruments
1/ The share of electricity supplies covered by RES should reach 6% by 2010 and 13% by 2020
2/ The share covered by CHP should be 19% in 2010 (and a higher share by 2020)
Walloon Region (authority CwAPE) :
Both high efficiency CHP and RES electricity productions generate green certificates. 
26,7% of electricity supplies should be covered by 2015, 37,9%  by 2020, yielding 8 000 GWh of electricity from RES.","Principle of a system of green certificates : 1. A green certificate is allocated to a producer of green electricity every time its production avoids the emission of a fixed amount of CO2, if it had to be produced in a reference fossil fuel plant (natural gas CCGT). 2. Each year, a predefined (and annually increasing) percentage of electricity supplied to end users has to be covered by green electricity. Suppliers must restitute the necessary number of green certificates to demonstrate that they respect that rule. In case of  failure, a penalty fee is due. This situation creates a market for green certificates for the benefit of green electricity producers. In Flanders, a similar process is established for CHP, while CHP is integrated in the green certificates system in Brussels and Wallonia. Green certificates and CHP certificates : share of electricity sales to be covered by RES and/or high efficiency CHP. Guaranteed minimum income for suppliers of green energy. Shares are regularly updated by regional regulation authorities.

NL-ENS-001,NL,Netherlands,1,Emission Trading System,To limit the absolute amount of GHG emissions in Europe at lowest cost (through trading),"The EU ETS sets a cap on total direct GHG emissions for its participants (mostly energy generation and heavy industry in participating countries). The EU ETS phase I and II covered in the Netherlands approximately 400 installations. Nitrous oxide emissions from certain processes are also covered. In January 2012 the Dutch Ministry published his National Allocation Plan for the free allocation of allowances for the third trading period (Min I&M, 2012) .                                                                                          The EU-ETS officially began on January 1, 2005 and consists of a “pilot” phase (phase I) from 2005-2007, with the second phase (phase II) from 2008-2012 set to coincide with the Kyoto compliance period. The EU ETS sets a cap on total direct GHG emissions for its participants. Individual participants in phase I and II got a number of emission allowances for free and can buy additional allowances if they need more, assuming other participants have spare allowances to sell. The price of the allowances will influence participants' decision to invest in emission reduction measures or to buy allowances when they are faced with a shortage of allowances compared to their actual emissions.
In phase I and II, each country determined the total amount of allowances available for its national participants with the guidelines and limits of the Directive, but allowances can be traded internationally (i.e. there is no national cap on emissions). The EU ETS phase I and II covers CO2 emissions from some ~11,000 installations in Europe, in the Netherlands approximately 400 installations are covered under the EU-ETS. From 2013 onwards (EU ETS III) the system for allocating emission allowances will significantly change compared to the two previous trading periods (2005-2012). Most important changes are:
• Emission allowances will be distributed according to fully harmonised and EU-wide rules, meaning that the same rules will apply across all EU Member States. 
• Auctioning will be the rule for the power sector, which means that the majority of allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System will not anymore be allocated for free. 
• For industry, a part of the allowances will still be given for free (depending on the vulnerability to carbon leakage and their relative performance compared to similar European companies), but this part will decrease over time. 
• The scheme will be expanded in Phase III, with the aviation sector, petrochemicals, ammonia and aluminium industries and to additional gases (like N20). 
At the same time a series of important changes to the way the EU ETS works will take effect in order to strengthen the system.

• Increase the energy production with renewables to 212 PJ in 2020 (including approximately 12 PJ of wind energy);
• Reduce the emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases by 25-30% in 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
The covenant furthermore includes more detailed plans are targets for specific sub-sectors. These targets and plans build on earlier agreements and/or link to other specific policy instruments. E.g:
• The horticulture sector agreed to reduce the emission by GHG by 45% in 2020 compared to 1990 levels. Among others this needs to be achieved through: semi-closed greenhouse (25% in 2020) and the introduction of a CO2 emissions trading for the businesses not covered by the EU-ETS.
• To reduce the amount of km driven by within the sector with about 14 million km.

For example, by saving energy or even generating their own. But these initiatives do not always get off the ground, perhaps because of confusion about licences, lack of collaborative partners, or ambiguous regulations. Central Government would like to help to remove some of these barriers. To this end it enters into voluntary “Green Deals” with different stakeholder in society on energy saving, local generation of renewable energy on efficient use and recycling of (other) resources (minerals, water) on sustainable transport and on saving biodiversit. In 2011 a first round was opened for stakeholders in which they had the opportunity to put forward a proposal for a Green Deal, followed by futher deals.

On average this amount to a deduction of the investments cost by ~10%. Annually the ministry publishes the available budget for the EIA, for 2012 the available budget is 115 million euro (AgNL, 2012) . Equipment that meets the general saving standards of the EIA is eligible for support. This equipment is listed in an energy list which is updated every year. The energy-efficient equipment must save more energy than the conventional equipment available in the market. Technologies that have reached a certain market share or for which the costs decreased substantially are taken of the list. Companies can also fill a request to put a specific energy saving technology on the list. If the technology meets certain criteria it will be integrated in the list (AgNL, 2011) .

The SDE is the successor of MEP incentive scheme (Environmental quality of electricity production) that was in place from 2003 until 2006.
The SDE offers long-term financial support (12-15 years) for the production of renewable energy (electricity, gas or heat) by covering the unprofitable component of projects. The unprofitable component is determined by including a basic amount in the decision to grant a subsidy. This is the average cost price of the renewable energy option, often the sum of the investment and operating costs, plus a reasonable profit margin, divided by the expected quantity of produced sustainable energy. 
The level of the subsidy is the difference between the basic amount and the energy price. The energy price is determined at the end of each calendar year for the preceding year. The energy price may differ for each category. As the correction amount can differ from year to year, the producer receives a different subsidy amount per produced energy unit per calendar year. Annually the Ministry publishes the list of technologies eligible for funding and the basis amounts per technology.
The following technologies are covered e.g. by the scheme in 2012 (Min EL&I ,2011; ECN 2011): wind energy (on and off shore), solar PV (certain type of applications), waste incineration, biomass fermentation, incineration and thermal conversion, hydropower, geothermal energy and solar thermal energy (>100m2).",Economic,Energy supply: RES Directive 2009/28/EC (repealing RES-E Directive 2001/77/EC and Biofuel Directive 2003/30/EC),,,Energy supply: RES Directive 2009/28/EC (repealing RES-E Directive 2001/77/EC and Biofuel Directive 2003/30/EC),CO2,non EU ETS,Energy supply,Implemented,2008,,,National government,EZ/AgNL,with existing measures (WEM),The PAM has changed over the years somewhatwith regard to its contents and implmentation (from SDE to SDE+),Frequent monitoring,10050,,10050,18000,,18000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,,na,,,OK,

There are separate standards for residential buildings and different types of non-residential buildings. Since 1995 the standards have been tightened several times, and further tightening is proposed for the near future The ultimate aim is zero-energy new buildings (EPC=0) in 2020, in accordance with the objective of the recasted EPBD (see below).
 Energy Performance Coefficient (EPC)
15 December 1995 > 1,4

To support the tightening of the energy performance standard an agreement was concluded in 2008 (Spring agreement ) between the national government and market parties (The Dutch Construction and Infrastructure Federation, NEPROM [the Association of Dutch Project Development Companies] and the Dutch Banking Association (NVB)). The objectives set for the Spring agreement are to:
• improve energy performance of new buildings by 25% in 2011 and 50% in 2015 (in comparison with the 2007 building requirements)
• to develop a new energy performance standard, which better reflect the actual energy use of buildings and better attuned to the experience (comfort and housing costs) of the consumer.","Regulatory, Voluntary/ negotiated agreement, Fiscal, Economic",Energy consumption: Recast of the Energy performance of buildings (Directive 2010/31/EC) amending 2002/91/EC,Energy consumption: End-use efficiency and energy services 2006/32/EC repealing SAVE Directive (Directive 93/76/EEC),,Energy consumption: Recast of the Energy performance of buildings (Directive 2010/31/EC) amending 2002/91/EC; Energy consumption: End-use efficiency and energy services 2006/32/EC repealing SAVE Directive (Directive 93/76/EEC),CO2,non EU ETS,"Energy use - residential, Energy use -Industry / Construction, Energy supply, Energy supply",Implemented,1995,2020,,National government,,with existing measures (WEM),,In overall indicators,14,,14,16,,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,Reduced air polution,,,OK,

The program covers the residential as well as the non-residential sector and the objective of this program for the period up to 2020 is to save 100 PJ. This is equal to making 3.2 million existing buildings 20% to 30% more energy-efficient. The program includes a whole package of different instruments:
• Covenant with the housing cooperation’s: In 2008 an agreement was signed between the national government, Aedes and the Woonbond [Association of Landlords and Tenants]. The aim is to guarantee the active involvement of the corporations in realising the energy saving objectives of the “More with Less” programme. Corporations own about 2.3 million residential buildings and the aim is to achieve a saving of 24 Petajoules in the period 2008–2020. For new buildings the aim is to reduce energy consumption by 25% by 1 January 2011 and 50% by 1 January 2015 in comparison with the regulations in force on 1 January 2007.
• Customized Advice More with Less. The customized advice provides a tailor-made report of the energy-saving measures that can be implemented, what the cost are and how much savings can be achieved. In 2009 and 2010 building owners could apply for subsidize advice, in total an amount of €13 million was available. At this moment (February 2012) no grants are available for a customized Energy advice.
• National subsidy scheme. In July 2010 the National Government made € 15 million available for home owners who implement energy-saving measures. They can apply for a subsidy between €300 and €750 depending on the improvement they make on their energy label. The subsidy scheme expired in 2011, and no new schemes are planned at the moment (February 2012).
• Temporary Subsidy Scheme for low energy glazing. Owner-occupiers and owners’ associations could receive a subsidy to buy low energy glazing for homes built before 1995. A total of €45 million was available for the whole period of the scheme (2009-2010).
• Lower VAT on insulation. Currently a reduced VAT rate of 6% instead of 19% applies for energy-saving measures (ground, roof and facade insulation). The lower VAT rate applies for material and labour costs for renovation and restoration work performed.
Besides a numbers of measures are (or have been) in place that provide home owners with a discount on the market interest for loans taken out by home owners for investments in energy saving. These include(d): (1) Energy Saving Credit Guarantee scheme that ran until 30 June 2011, (2) The Green Projects Scheme which offers a tax rebate on green investments. The scheme changed on 1 January 2011 so the tax benefit for savers and investors will be reduced in stages from 2.5% to 0% in 2014.

Taxing energy use makes energy saving (by changing behaviour or investing in energy-saving measures) more attractive. The energy tax is levied on electricity and natural gas, and the level of the of the Energy Tax is depended on 1) the energy consumption of a customer; the higher the consumption, the lower the energy tax levied, and 2) specific agreements between different sectors and the government.
For small (residential) consumers the Energy Tax accounts for approximately ~40% of the natural gas and ~30% of electricity price in 2012 (Rijksoverheid, 2012) . Industrial consumers pay a much lower tariff because of their larger consumption. Besides there is a special clause in the 'Environmental Taxes Act’ (Article 36q), which exempts companies that enter into a long term agreement with the government from paying energy taxes on electricity consumption that goes over 25 million kWh per year and from taxes on fuel for non-energy use (feedstocks). Besides the Energy Tax has a separate lower gas rate for the horticulture sector (fixed up to 2013). This means that these companies are taxed in the same way as the energy-intensive large-scale consumers. In return the sector entered into voluntary agreements on energy efficiency with the government.","Fiscal, Economic",National policy not related to EU policies,,,National policy not related to EU policies,CO2,"EU ETS, non EU ETS","Energy use -Industry / Construction, Energy supply",Implemented,1996,,,National government,,with existing measures (WEM),,In overall indicators,,,,,,,,,,Yes,Other PAMs,,,,,,,,,,Yes,With various energy saving measures,Reduced air pollution,,,OK,

With the recast of the Directive in 2009 (EC, 2009)  also energy-related products, such as insulating materials and shower heads, are covered under the Directive. Besides the Energy Labelling Directive was adapted to ensure that its scope is equal to that of the Ecodesign Directive (EC, 2010) . The Ecodesign Directive is a framework directive, i.e. that separate Implementing Measures are establish holding the requirements for the various product.

To contribute to achieving this target fuel suppliers in the Netherlands are imposed with the legal obligations to blend their transport fuels with a certain share of sustainable biofuels (Stb, 2011) : 
• in 2011 a share of 4.25%;
• in 2012 a share of 4.5%;
• in 2013 a share of 5%;
• in 2014 a share of 5.5%. 
For biofuels to be allowed to count towards the target they must meet certain sustainability criteria. Contribution made by biofuels produced from wastes, residues, non-food cellulosic material, and ligno-cellulosic material are considered to be twice that made by other biofuels. Policies to stimulate the uptake of biofuels already started back in 2003. Following the European Biofuels Directive 2003 (2003/30/EC) the Netherlands introduced legislation to stimulate the consumption of biofuels. In 2006 a partial exemption of fuel taxes was introduced for imported biofuels. Since 1 January 2007 fuel suppliers are imposed with an obligation to blend their sold transport fuels with a certain percentage (on an energy basis) of biofuels.

NL-TRA-003,NL,Netherlands,18,Fiscal policy on car efficiency,Objective of this policy to curb the emission of CO2 from transport by stimulating the purchase of passenger cars with low CO2 emission through fiscal incentives,"There are various fiscal measures in place that influence the uptake of energy/CO2 efficient passenger cars:
• Passenger Car and Motorcycle tax (Dutch: BPM): The Private motor vehicle and motorcycle tax (Dutch: BPM) is a tax levied on the purchase of new cars. Since 1 July 2006 a new Private Motor Vehicle & Motorcycle Tax regulation (bonus-penalty scheme) came into place aimed at stimulating the uptake of more energy efficient cars. Each new passenger car could receive a reduction on the BPM depending on the car’s energy label. The aim of the scheme was to reward the most energy efficiency cars in their class size with a bonus (A- and B-label cars) on the BPM and to penalise relatively inefficient cars with a surcharge on the BPM (D to G label cars). In 2008 the scheme was adapted by increasing the bonuses and penalties and introducing an additional tax for very energy inefficient cars. Starting in 2010 the scheme has changed into a system in which the level of BPM depends on the absolute CO2 emissions per km of a car. From 2012 onwards the BPM will only depend on the absolute CO2 emission per km of a car.
• Motor Vehicle Tax (MRB). The level of the Motor Vehicle Tax is differentiated by weight of the car. Exemption is provided until 2014 for vehicles with an emissions factor below 110 gr of CO2 per km using petrol and 95 gr CO2 per km using diesel. In 2015 only vehicles with an emission below 50 gr of CO2 per km are exempted from the tax.
• Income tax measures. In the Netherlands leased cars, which are also used for the private purposes of the employee, are seen as part of the income. The employee must pay income tax over cost price including tax. Since 2008 the systems is designed in such a way that car drivers with a lease car are fiscally encouraged to obtain an energy efficient car. This differentiation has influence to shift towards the lease of cars with lower CO2 emissions per km.

NL-TRA-004,NL,Netherlands,19,EU CO2 emission standards for cars,Objective if this policy is to curb the CO2 emissions of transport by setting CO2 standards for new passenger cars and delivery vans that apply for all cars that are sold within the European Union,"Firstly the regulation sets CO2 emission performance standards sets for new passenger cars registered in the EC with the aim to achieve the overall objective of the European Community of 120 g CO2/km as average emissions for the new car fleet. The regulation sets the average CO2 emissions for new passenger cars at 130 g CO2/km by 2012, by means of improvement in vehicle motor technology, and from 2020 onwards the Regulation sets a target of 95 g CO2/km as average emissions for the new car fleet. This Regulation will be complemented by additional measures corresponding to a reduction of 10 g CO2/km as part of the Community’s integrated approach (amongst others through the use of biofuels and electric vehicles).
Secondly for light duty vehicle the regulation sets CO2 emission performance standards according to the mass of vehicle, using a limit value curve. The curve is set in such a way that a fleet average of 175 grams of CO2/km is achieved in 2017 and 147 grams of CO2/km in 2020. The limit value curve means that heavier vans are allowed higher emissions than lighter vans. Furthermore the regulation gives manufacturers additional incentives to produce light duty vehicles with extremely low emissions (below 50g/km). Each low-emitting van will be counted as 3.5 vehicles in 2014 and 2015, 2.5 in 2016 and 1.5 vehicles in 2017.","Regulatory, Voluntary/ negotiated agreement, Fiscal, Economic","Transport: Voluntary agreement with car manufacturers to reduce specific CO2 emissions (ACEA, KAMA, JAMA)",Transport: Regulation on CO2 from cars 2009/443/EC,,"Transport: Voluntary agreement with car manufacturers to reduce specific CO2 emissions (ACEA, KAMA, JAMA); Transport: Regulation on CO2 from cars 2009/443/EC",CO2,non EU ETS,"Transport, Energy use - other (commercial and agricultural), Energy use - residential, Energy use -Industry / Construction, Energy supply",Implemented,2009,2020,,National government,,with existing measures (WEM),,In overall indicators,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no,no,na,,,OK,

EPCs give information on a building's energy efficiency in a sliding scale from 'A' (very efficient) to 'G' (least efficient). A recommendations report setting out how the rating could be improved accompanies every EPC. EPC can help occupants make their building more energy efficient by identifying costs and opportunities for improvement. Display energy certificate (DEC) must be produced every year for public buildings larger than 1,000m². The DEC shows the actual running costs of the building and must be displayed in a prominent place. Additionally the regulations require the regular inspection of air-conditioning installations and boilers above a certain size.

As part of this exercise we analysed the extent to which policies targeting other issues impacted on GHG emissions. Statistics on the rates of uptake of relevant measures were taken into account and mapped onto policy requirements. Although it is difficult to attribute measure uptake to policies with 100% confidence, the results indicated that approximately 1.1Mt CO2e abatement is delivered through the existing regulatory baseline, the majority of which is driven by the NVZ regulations.","Nitrogen use efficiency, nitrate leaching, ammonia emissions, N2O emissions, agricultural productivity, manure management and associated CH4 and N2O emissions",Yes,,,"The nitrates action plan is aimed towards reducing nitrate leaching in high risk areas. This requires farmers to have approriate slurry storage and applies restrictions on spreading slurry and manure onto fields. The main costs associated with this policy are capital costs to build slurry storage and administrative costs. The main benefits are a reduction in Nitrates, Ammonia and Greenhouse gases. The 2012 Review of Progress in Reducing GHG emissions from English Agriculture identified the Nitrates Action plan as a key driver for certain cost negative farm practices. In particular it promotes the use of a nutrient management system, which has also positive effect on emissions (GHG, nitrates, ammonia). Taking the latter into account we expect the overall costs to be negative.",,No,,Reduced Nitrates and Ammonia,Start data is for implementaiton of the 2012 review of the National Action Plan.,Luke Spadavecchia (DEFRA),Details incomplete,
